# ---------------------------------------------------------
# Helm chart to install IBM Storage Enabler for Containers.
# Enables IBM Storage with Kubernetes by implementing Kubernetes Dynamic Provisioner and FlexVolume.
#
# IBM Storage Enabler for Containers includes the following main images:
#   - deployment/ubiquity                 : A mediator between IBM Storage and k8s FlexVolume \ Dynamic Provisioner.
#   - deployment/ubiquity-db              : Stores meta-data for the dynamic provisioned volumes.
#   - deamonset/ubiquity-k8s-flex         : Implements k8s FlexVolume driver.
#   - deployment/ubiquity-k8s-provisioner : Implements k8s Dynamic Provisioner
