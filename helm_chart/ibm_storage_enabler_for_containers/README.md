## Introduction
IBM Storage Enabler for Containers (ISEC) allows IBM storage systems to be used as persistent volumes for stateful applications running in Kubernetes clusters.
Thus, the containers can be used with stateful microservices, such as database applications (MongoDB, PostgreSQL etc).
IBM Storage Enabler for Containers uses Kubernetes dynamic provisioning for creating and deleting volumes on IBM storage systems.
In addition, IBM Storage Enabler for Containers utilizes the full set of Kubernetes FlexVolume APIs for volume operations on a host.
The operations include initiation, attachment/detachment, mounting/unmounting etc..

## Chart Details
This chart includes:
* A Storage Enabler for Containers server deployment is used as the server for running Kubernetes Dynamic Provisioner and FlexVolume.
* A Storage Enabler for Containers database deployment is used to store the persistent data for Enabler for Container server.
* A Kubernetes Dynamic Provisioner deployment is for creation storage volumes on-demand, using Kubernetes storage classes based on Spectrum Connect storage services.
* A Kubernetes FlexVolume DaemonSet is used for attaching and mounting storage volumes into a pod within a Kubernetes node.

## Prerequisites
Before installing the helm chart, verify following:
1. Install and configure IBM Spectrum Connect, according to the application requirements.
2. Establish a proper communication link between Spectrum Connect and Kubernetes cluster.
3. For each worker node:
   1. Install relevant Linux packages to ensure Fibre Channel and iSCSI connectivity.
   2. Configure Linux multipath devices on the host.
   3. Configure storage system connectivity.
   4. Make sure that the node kubelet service has the attach/detach capability enabled.
4. For each master node:
   1. Enable the attach/detach capability for the kubelet service.
   2. If the controller-manager is configured to run as a pod in your Kubernetes cluster, allow for event recording in controller-manager log file.
5. If dedicated SSL certificates are required, see the Managing SSL certificates section in the IBM Storage Enabler for Containers.
6. When using IBM Cloud Private with the Spectrum Virtualize Family products, use only hostnames for the Kubernetes cluster nodes, do not use IP addresses.

These configuration steps are mandatory and cannot be skipped. See the IBM Storage Enabler for Containers user guide for their detailed description.

## PodSecurityPolicy Requirements
This chart requires a PodSecurityPolicy to be bound to the target namespace prior to installation or to be bound to the current namespace during installation by setting "globalConfig.defaultPodSecurityPolicy.clusterRole". 

The predefined PodSecurityPolicy name: ibm-anyuid-hostpath has been verified for this chart, if your target namespace is bound to this PodSecurityPolicy you can proceed to install the chart.
The predefined clusterRole name: ibm-anyuid-hostpath-clusterrole has been verified for this chart, if you use it you can proceed to install the chart.

## Resources Required
* Describes Minimum System Resources Required

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `my-release`:

```bash
$ helm install --name my-release --namespace ubiquity stable/ibm_storage_enabler_for_containers
```

The command deploys <Chart name> on the Kubernetes cluster in the default configuration. The [configuration](#configuration) section lists the parameters that can be configured during installation.


> **Tip**: List all releases using `helm list`

### Verifying the Chart
You can check the status by running:
```bash
$ helm status my-release
```

If all statuses are free of errors, you can run sanity test by:
```bash
$ helm test my-release
```

### Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall/delete the `my-release` release:

```bash
$ helm delete my-release --purge
```

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release.

This command fails if any of the following resources do not exist: serviceAccount, role, clusterRole, roleBinding, clusterRoleBinding with same name `ubiquity-helm-hook`. To continue the deletion, first create these entities.
> **Tip**: You can generate the manifests of these resources by running the "helm install --debug â€“dry-run" command with same release name, namespace and other values.

Specify each parameter using the `--set key=value[,key=value]` argument to `helm install`.

Alternatively, a YAML file that specifies the values for the parameters can be provided while installing the chart.

## Storage
* Define how storage works with the workload
* Dynamic vs PV pre-created
* Considerations if using hostpath, local volume, empty dir
* Loss of data considerations
* Any special quality of service or security needs for storage

## Limitations
* Only one instance of IBM Storage Enabler for Containers can be deployed in a Kubernetes cluster.
*  None of the deployments under this chart  support scaling. Thus, their replica must be 1.

## Documentation
* Can have as many supporting links as necessary for this specific workload however don't overload the consumer with unnecessary information.
* Can be links to special procedures in the knowledge center.
