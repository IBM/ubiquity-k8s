This project includes components for managing [Kubernetes persistent storage](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes), using [Ubiquity](https://github.com/IBM/ubiquity) service.
- Ubiquity Dynamic Provisioner for creating and deleting persistent volumes
- Ubiquity FlexVolume Driver CLI for attaching and detaching persistent volumes

The IBM official solution for Kubernetes, based on the Ubiquity project, is referred to as IBM Storage Enabler for Containers. You can download the installation package and its documentation from [IBM Fix Central](http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/quickorder?parent=Software%20defined%20storage&product=ibm/StorageSoftware/IBM+Storage+Enabler+for+Containers&release=All&platform=All&function=all&source=fc).

Ubiquity supports the following storage systems:
* IBM block storage.

   IBM block storage is supported for Kubernetes via IBM Spectrum Connect. Ubiquity communicates with the IBM storage systems through Spectrum Connect. Spectrum Connect creates a storage profile (for example, gold, silver or bronze) and makes it available for Kubernetes.
   
* IBM Spectrum Scale

   IBM Spectrum Scale file storage is supported for Kubernetes. Ubiquity communicates with IBM Spectrum Scale system directly via IBM Spectrum Scale management API v2.

The code is provided as is, without warranty. Any issue will be handled on a best-effort basis.
